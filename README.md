# QCan
Software for canonicalising SPARQL queries.

# Description
QCan is a free software for the canonicalisation of SPARQL queries.
This software works with queries under SPARQL 1.0 syntax. 
Developed as part of a master's thesis.

# Install

`mvn clean install`

# Benchmark

To run this software over a text file containing SPARQL queries (one per line) execute:

> java Benchmark filename numberOfQueries

Options:
* -l to enable the leaning of graphs.
* -o to enable the processing of queries containing OPTIONAL clauses.
* -f to enable the processing of queries containing FILTER expressions.

The MultipleGenerator class contains a main type that creates SPARQL queries from graphs (contained in the eval folder). We create queries where nodes are variables connected by a fixed predicate.

> java MultipleGenerator outputFile timeout

The UCQGeneratorTest class contains a main type that creates SPARQL queries that are "hard" to process. 
These queries contain n conjunctions of patterns containing m disjunctions.

> java UCQGeneratorTest conjunctions unions
